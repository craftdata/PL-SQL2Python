* Project description

This project provides a tool to transform Oracle PL/SQL package to python package, and a runtime library to simulate Oracle internal functions. 

* How to use it?

o2t.exe [/path/to/oracle/plsql/script]

The source scripts MUST have a suffix as ".sql", and the target python scripts are outputed in the same directory. For example, "ot2.txt c:\pkg-abc.sql" would output a python file named pkg-abc.py in "c:\".

* Issues

Right now, there is only a windows binary transformer(from Oracle PL/SQL to HiveQL) for you to evaluate.

I will add the missing runtime libs in a few days.

* Updates

I have add the source code for o2t transformer.

PLSQL.g is the core ANTLR code to parse plsql script to python script (target for Hive environment). Use run_antlrworks.sh to generate parser code in 'output' directory.

ANTLRNoCaseFileStream.java and pl2py.java are wrappers for ANTLR generated classes.

* How to Compile
make
make run

Put your plsql code in 'input' directory. After you call 'make run', the generated python scripts are in 'result' directory.

Contributed it and enjoy it, thank you!
