* Project description

This project provides a tool to transform Oracle PL/SQL package to python package, and a runtime library to simulate Oracle internal functions. 

* How to use it?

o2t.exe [/path/to/oracle/plsql/script]

The source scripts MUST have a suffix as ".sql", and the target python scripts are outputed in the same directory. For example, "ot2.txt c:\pkg-abc.sql" would output a python file named pkg-abc.py in "c:\".

* Issues

Right now, there is only a windows binary transformer(from Oracle PL/SQL to HiveQL) for you to evaluate.

I will add the missing runtime libs in a few days.
